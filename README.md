# Outline steps in this project are:
1. Import all the required libraries (some libraries may be imported later)
2. Load and prepare the data for analysis. This step include:

    ~ Check for null and unique values for test and train sets
    
    ~ Find and remove outliers from the datasets 
    
    ~ Check variance from categorical variables
    
    ~ Remove variables with very little to zero variance
    
    ~ Apply label encoder
    
3. Perform dimensionality reduction
4. XGBoost Analysis:

    ~ Predict your test values using XGBoost
    
    ~ k-fold Cross Validation using XGBoost
    
    ~ Test data prediction using XGBoost
